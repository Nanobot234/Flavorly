# Flavorly
An iOS app to display recipes from a provided endpoint

### Steps to Run the App
1. Clone or download the project from the repository.
2. Open the `Flavorly.xcodeproj` file in Xcode.
3. Select the "Flavorly" scheme.
4. Click the "Run" button (or press `Cmd + R`).
### Focus Areas
I prioritized the UI design on the and also the arcitecture of the app. I prioritized the UI/UX because I feel that having a gerate user experience and design of the application is very important as that is what primarily makes users use an app and makes it easy to use. I also focused on the architecture of the app as it is essential to keep the code clean and o

### Time Spent
I spent about 10 hours on the project, and this was scattered over several days. I allocated about 60% of my time on the front end part of the code and about 40% on the backend

### Trade-offs and Decisions
There werent significant tradeoffs I had to make , as I was able to implement all the necessary features of this application

### Weakest Part of the Project
My project likley has the greatest weakness in part of the loading of the recipe list. The background for each list item is based on a computed gradient coloring. This effect does take time to load and can potentially slow down the app if there are a large number of recipes. But I included it because I feel that this effect gives the app a unique visual feel


### External Code and Dependencies:
**KingFisher**: KingFisher easily displays and caches the images from the web for each recipe.

### Additional Information: 
As a developer still in the early stages of my career(about 2 years experience) I am continuing to learn and have learned some new concepts from this project. I am eager to continue to grow my technical and interpersonal skills while working at Fetch, or even as a fetch apprentice which I also applied for as well. Thank you.
